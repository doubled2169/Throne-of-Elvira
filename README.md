# Throne-of-Elvira
Journey for the game I am creating

Hello and welcome! This is a short description and log for the game I am creating using GoDot and Aseprite.

The name of the game is **Throne of Elvira**. It is inspired after Darkest Dungeon with similar mechanics like stress, party and resource management but with pixelated graphics and a more light hearted approach.

**Are you brave enough to adventure into the corrupted lands of Lo'dram? Assemble a party of heroes seeking fame and riches and clean the lands of the corruption that spreads each day deeper and deeper into the land of Lo'dram. But beware, once you embark... you either come out victorious... or become just another tale...**

Main mechanics:
  - Corruption: It increases slowly or it is increased by enemies causing characters to become afflicted and gain different major buffs or debuffs and can be restored but you need to visit the town to "cure" an afflicted character.
  - Party management: Create a party of maximum of 4 heroes with different abilities, weaknesses and strenghts for different situations.
  - Main hub: The town is the main hub where you can upgrade weapons, armor and abilities of the heroes but be careful, if a hero dies, **he is gone forever**....
  - Procedurally generated levels with rooms where the main loot, quests and fights that happen and hallways with random encounters from ambushes to loot or who knows what other surprises?
